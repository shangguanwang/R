#'Structured Query Language', is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases.
#All commands: https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-commands?r=master
#A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.Tables are sometimes referred to as relations. 
#By convention, commands=clauses are written in capital letters. 

#Some of the most common data types are:
#1. Integer, a positive or negative whole number 
#2. Text, a text string 
#3. Date, the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD for the year, month, and day 
#4. Real, a decimal value

---------------------------------- $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Query $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$----------------------------
Summary:
SELECT is the clause you use every time you want to query information from a database.
WHERE is a popular command that lets you filter the results of the query based on conditions that you specify.
LIKE and BETWEEN are special operators that can be used in a WHERE clause
AND and OR are special operators that you can use with WHERE to filter the query on two or more conditions.
ORDER BY lets you sort the results of the query in either ascending or descending order.
LIMIT lets you specify the maximum number of rows that the query will return. This is especially important in large tables that have thousands or even millions of rows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT DISTINCT col FROM tablename
#returns unique values in the specified column(s)
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies;
---------------------------------
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE imdb_rating >8;

#Common operators used with the WHERE clause are:
= equals
!= not equals
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
---------------------------------
#LIKE is a special operator that can be used in a WHERE clause
#Se_en represents a pattern with a wildcard character. The _ means you can substitute any individual character here without breaking the pattern. The names Seven and Se7en both match this pattern.
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';  #pick row with name=='Se_en'  # _ means any character

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE 'a%';   # a% begin with the letter "A" #%a end with "a"

#any movie that contains the word "man" in its name will be returned in the result set. Notice, that LIKE is not case sensitive. "Batman" and "Man Of Steel" both appear in the result set.
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE name LIKE '%man%';  
--------------------------------- BETWEEN
#The BETWEEN operator is used to filter the result set within a certain range. The values can be numbers, text or dates.
#only include movies with names that begin with letters "A" [up to but not including "J".]
SELECT * FROM movies 
WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';

# only include movies with years between 1990 up to and including 2000.
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000;

SELECT * FROM movies 
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000
AND genre='comedy';

SELECT * FROM movies
ORDER BY imdb_rating DESC;

# specify the maximum number of rows the result set will have. 
SELECT * FROM movies
ORDER BY imdb_rating ASC
LIMIT 3;  

---------------------------------- $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Aggregate Functions $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$----------------------------
###Summary:
Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.
COUNT takes the name of a column(s) as an argument and counts the number of rows where the value(s) is not NULL.
GROUP BY is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
SUM() takes the column name as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in that column.
MAX() takes the column name as an argument and returns the largest value in that column.
MIN() takes the column name as an argument and returns the smallest value in that column.
AVG() takes a column name as an argument and returns the average value for that column.
ROUND() takes two arguments, a column name and the number of decimal places to round the values in that column.

#Count how many apps are in the database. In the code editor replace the previous statement with
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fake_apps;
---------------------------------
#Count(colname) counts the number of rows where the column is not NULL.
# return the total number of free apps in the table
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM fake_apps
WHERE price=0;
---------------------------------Count the number of apps at each price. Get two cols: price & count
#GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that is only used with aggregate functions. It is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups.
#Here, our aggregate function is COUNT() and we are passing price as an argument to GROUP BY. SQL will count the total number of apps for each price in the table.
#It is usually helpful to SELECT the column you pass as an argument to GROUP BY. Here we select price and COUNT(*). You can see that the result set is organized into two columns making it easy to see the number of apps at each price.

SELECT price,COUNT(*) FROM fake_apps 
GROUP BY price;

SELECT price, COUNT(*) FROM fake_apps
WHERE downloads>20000
GROUP BY price;
---------------------------------total number of downloads for all of the apps combined
SELECT SUM(downloads) FROM fake_apps;
---------------------------------Calculate the total number of downloads for each category
SELECT category, SUM(downloads) FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category;
---------------------------------How many downloads does the most/least popular app have
SELECT MAX(downloads) FROM fake_apps;
SELECT MIN(downloads) FROM fake_apps;
---------------------------------Return the names of the most/least downloaded apps in each category. 
#Three cols: name, category, max(downloads)
SELECT name, category, MAX(downloads) FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category;

SELECT name,category,MIN(downloads) FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY category;
--------------------------------- average number of downloads 
SELECT AVG(downloads) FROM fake_apps;
---------------------------------Calculate the average number of downloads at each price. 
SELECT price,AVG(downloads) FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price;
####################rounding the average number of downloads to two decimal places for each price. 
SELECT price,ROUND(AVG(downloads),2) FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price;
#################### round to the nearest integer
SELECT price,ROUND(AVG(downloads)) FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price;
